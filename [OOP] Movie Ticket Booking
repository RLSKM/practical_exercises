# Task 1: Movie Ticket Booking System

You are tasked to create a Ticket Booking System for a movie theatre that requires users to book tickets to watch their movies. The booking system uses classes such as 'Movie' and 'Booking' to store details on the movies and booking slots.

## Task 1.1

You are required to tasked to create a class Movie with the attributes Title, Duration, Screening_Times and Max_Seats. The screening times should be 

Your function should:
- read the file `image.txt` containing the pixel data
- store the pixel data in a 2-dimensional list, where each element in a row is a tuple with integer RGB values.

Test your program by reading the pixel data and outputting the first 5 rows of the 2D list.

---

## Task 1.2

Write a Python function `monochrome(pixel_data)` that takes the 2-dimensional list of RGB pixel data as input and converts the image to monochrome. 



To convert to monochrome:
- for each pixel, calculate the average of the R, G, and B values
- replace the RGB tuple of each pixel with a single integer representing the grayscale value (the average).

Test your program by outputting the first 5 rows of the monochrome image.

For example, the **first** row should be:

`[85, 170, 140, 85, 85, 85, 216, 216, 170, 85, 85, 170, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 140, 170, 170]`

---

## Task 1.3

Write a Python function `blur(data)` to apply a simple Gaussian blur to the monochrome image. 

The function should:
- for each pixel in the image (except border pixels), calculate the average grayscale value of the pixel and its 8 immediate neighbors (surrounding pixels in a 3x3 grid)
- replace the pixelâ€™s grayscale value with this average to achieve a blurring effect
- ensure that the border pixels remain unchanged.

Test your program by outputting the first 5 rows of the blurred image.

For example, the **first two rows** should be:

```
[85, 170, 140, 85, 85, 85, 216, 216, 170, 85, 85, 170, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 140, 170, 170]
[170, 147, 147, 119, 94, 123, 157, 182, 143, 125, 116, 128, 131, 116, 103, 100, 106, 130, 134, 170]
```

## Task 1.4

Write a procedure `write_monochrome(filename, data)` to save the processed 2D list of monochrome pixel values to a text file.

---

The monochrome pixel values should be separated by a single space.

Test your procedure by saving both the monochrome and blurred image data into `monochrome.txt` and `blurred.txt` respectively.
